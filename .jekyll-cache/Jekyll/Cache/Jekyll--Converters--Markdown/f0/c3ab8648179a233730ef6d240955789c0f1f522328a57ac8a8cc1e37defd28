  <p>A two-phase flow analysis code, CUPID, has been developed for a realistic simulation of thermalâ€“hydraulic phenomena in nuclear reactor components. In the CUPID code, a two-fluid three-field model is adopted and the governing equations are solved on unstructured meshes. To obtain the numerical solution, the semi-implicit method of the RELAP5 code was used with some modifications for a cell-centered finite volume method. In this work, a second-order upwind method was implemented for the convective terms of the CUPID code. To get the slopes of the convective quantities, we adopted the Frinkâ€™s reconstruction method (1994, AIAA Paper 94-0061) and modified it for an application to arbitrary polyhedral cells. To stabilize the numerical solutions, the Barth and Jespersonâ€™s slope limiter was used. In order to evaluate the enhanced accuracy and ensure the robustness of the implemented scheme, numerical tests were performed using conceptual single- and two-phase flow problems, which include a strong phase change and very heterogeneous phase distributions.</p>

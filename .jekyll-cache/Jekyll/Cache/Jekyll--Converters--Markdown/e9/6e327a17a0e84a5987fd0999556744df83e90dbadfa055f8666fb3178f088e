I"g<p><strong>SALOME</strong> is an open-source software that provides a generic Pre- and Post-Processing platform for numerical simulation. As a preprocessor, SALOME provides versatile functionalities for creation, visualization and modification of geometric CAD models. <strong>SMESH</strong>(Mesh module in SALOME) is to create meshes on the basis of geometrical models created or imported into SALOME. It uses a set of meshing algorithms and their corresponding conditions (hypotheses) to compute meshes. In addition, a new mesher can be easily connected to this module by using the existing plugin mechanism.</p>

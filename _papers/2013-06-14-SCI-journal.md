>For the analysis of transient two-phase flows in nuclear reactor components, a three-dimensional thermal-hydraulic code, named CUPID, has been developed. In the present study, the CUPID code was applied for the simulation of the PASCAL test facility constructed with an aim of validating the cooling and operational performance of the passive auxiliary feedwater system (PAFS). The PAFS is one of the advanced safety features adopted in the Advanced Power Reactor + (APR+), which is intended to completely replace the conventional active auxiliary feedwater system. This paper introduces the simulation results for the passive condensate cooling tank (PCCT) of the PASCAL facility performed with the CUPID code in order to investigate the thermal-hydraulic phenomena in the PCCT. The simulation showed that the important thermal-hydraulic characteristics in the PCCT, such as two-phase natural circulation and boil-off phenomena, can be successfully reproduced by CUPID. Two important validation parameters, collapsed water level and local liquid temperature, were quantitatively well captured in the simulation. This paper presents the description of the PASCAL test facility, the physical models of the CUPID code, and its simulation result for the PCCT.

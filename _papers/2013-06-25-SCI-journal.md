>This paper summarizes the physical models and a modified numerical procedure for the lift force of the CUPID code to simulate a subcooled boiling flow. A part of these physical models and the numerical procedure were verified through a calculation of air–water flow tests. A subcooled boiling flow was then calculated to assess the whole implementation. These assessments indicate that the implementation of the physical models and a modified numerical scheme are appropriate, and that the calculated primary variables of a subcooled boiling flow such as the liquid velocity and void fraction profiles can be acceptable in general, though IATE and a turbulence model for a two-phase flow are needed to be improved for a better prediction.

>For the analysis of transient two-phase flows in nuclear reactor components, a three-dimensional thermal hydraulics code, named CUPID, has been being developed. We simulated the downcomer boiling experiment (DOBO) experiment in two-dimensions using the CUPID code to evaluate its two-phase flow models and verify its applicability to the downcomer boiling analysis. The simulation result showed that it can reproduce the important characteristics of the downcomer boiling, such as a flow pattern change from a bubbly flow to churn and mist flows and a circulation of liquid accelerated by bubbles. The two-phase flow models that require further improvement were identified as well for an enhanced prediction of the downcomer boiling.
